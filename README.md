# GuessGame

This is a game in which a user has 20 tries to guess the correct number. If the number is incorrect the score will drop by 1 point and the user will lose if the score gets to 0. The number range for this game in between 1 and 20.

This is not a sophisticated project but it is a great achievement in expanding my knowledge and practice in the world of DOM. Though this project did not take me very long, it serves as a stepping stone in helping me further understand the power of DOM through document structure, style, and content with some of the more common used methods. After my initial build, I was able to go back through and refactor my code
Using the DRY principle, commenting out my old code for viewing purposes.
